# Void's Custom Diablo 2 Resurgence Config

## Philosophy
Config should be systematic, not all over the place

Useless items should not be shown.

Less rare items should have shorter names.

Every item type should be separated with distinct colors, and thouse colors should be reflected on the minimap in addition to rarity of said items.

Additionally, items of note (bases or elites) should be denoted with markers that are easy to see and understand quickly.

## Implementation
Consumables - only big HP/MP/RP pots = green

Socketables/Charm components - runes > 5, gems > 3 = orange

Crafting/Mod = purple

Elite items = \<E\>
  
Bases = \<B\>
  
Items of note = \<I\>
  
Alchemy bases = \<A\>
